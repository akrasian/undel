<p><strong>Out</strong>: Monday, June 22, 2015.
</p><p><strong>Due</strong>: <s>Friday, July 17, 2015</s> Monday, July 20, 2015; Noon.
</p><p><strong>Initial code</strong> <a href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/%7Ecomp3430/code/assignment3-starter.tar.gz">starter</a> code.
</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> 18%
</p><p><strong>Make sure to start early!</strong> 

</p><h3>Preliminaries</h3>

<p>This assignment aims to recover from the following common situation: 
you've just finished writing an essay/report/paper due in the next hour,
 but before you print it, you accidentally manage to delete it. It would
 be very convenient to have a program for such situations capable of 
undeleting files, and that, in fact, is the goal of this project.

</p><p>Implementations of undelete are very file system-type specific. We're going to write undelete for the <code>ext2</code> file system, which was released close to 20 years ago now. The reason is that the file system layout in <code>ext2</code> is very similar to that of its successors, <code>ext3</code> and <code>ext4</code>, so it's pertinent to today's systems even if no one is using <code>ext2</code> any longer. Undelete is not possible for <code>ext3</code> and <code>ext4</code> without looking through the filesystem journal, which is a more complicated task than we would like to assign to you.

</p><p>This assignment leaves most everything up to you. The coding 
portion is relatively small; figuring out what to do is about half the 
assignment and getting it implemented is the other half.

</p><h3>Solution Plan</h3>

<p>After reading over the following description of the project and browsing through the linked <code>ext2</code> resources, we invite you and your fellow group members to come up with a plan for implementing your project. As "simple" as <code>ext2</code>
 is, it's still a complex filesystem, so there is a lot of room for 
poorly-though-out code to go very far astray. If you submit a plan for 
your project to <code>comp3430</code>via email by the next lab (<strong>B02</strong>
 Thursday), we will review it and give you feedback, which will 
hopefully save you from some major headaches close to the deadline. 
Furthermore in writing a plan you will be forced to learn the specifics 
of <code>ext2</code>, which is a great way to familiarize yourself with it prior to doing much or any coding.

</p><h3>Skeleton Files</h3>

<p>To start the assignment, you'll need to download a set of <a href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/%7Ecomp3430/code/assignment3-starter.tar.gz">files</a> that I have prepared. This includes:

</p><ul>
<li><code>FC13-CSE451-2012-03-22.tar.gz</code>: An older version of the 
linux kernel VMWare image. The newer kernel will zero out the inode 
values after deletion. This will make your life hard. Please download 
and use this <a href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/%7Ecomp3430/code/FC13-CSE451-2012-03-22.tar.gz">image</a>, instead. <strong>NOTE: Using the kernel from project 1 in it's current state will not allow you to run a successful undelete</strong>. Extra credit will be offered for those who can modify the <a href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/%7Ecomp3430/assignments/assign1.html">assignment 1</a> kernel to not zero out inode values.
</li><li> <code>ext2fs.h</code>: Include this file in your <code>.c</code> file for common <code>ext2</code> definitions (it includes the <code>ext2_types.h</code>
 header). You should rely on the macros provided here where possible 
instead of doing arithmetic related to sizes and offsets yourself in 
most cases.
</li><li><code>fileIOExample.c</code>: This is a simple example of doing file IO in C, in case you are unfamiliar with how it works.
</li><li><code>filesysFile-simple</code> and <code>filesysFile-easy</code>: These are two sample <code>ext2</code> filesystems on which you can start testing your code. You will definitely need to test more complex filesystems than these.
</li><li><code>mkFilesysFile.sh</code>: This is a script for creating 
and mounting ext2 filesystems. It takes two parameters: a file name and 
the number of 1kiB blocks to use. You'll need to specify at least 60 
blocks for it to succeed. Furthermore, you will need root access to 
mount a filesystem, so you'll need to use either a personal machine or 
the course virtual machine image.
</li></ul>

<h3>Your Task</h3>

<p>You will be creating a program to recover deleted files in <code>ext2</code> filesystems. In <code>ext2</code>,
 when a file is deleted, the file's inode and data blocks are marked as 
free, its directory entry is invalidated, the deleted time of the file's
 inode is set, and the number of hardlinks in the inode is set to 0. The
 key thing here, though, is that the file's inode and data blocks are 
still preserved, at least until the filesystem ends up reclaiming them. 
You will write a utility in C called <code>undelete</code> that is capable of recovering these files as follows:

</p><ul>
<li>Your <code>undelete</code> executable should take the name of a filesystem file as an argument, e.g. ./undelete [ext2fs-filename].
</li><li>For every deleted file in the specified filesystem, write the file to <code>recovered_files/[ext2fs-filename]/</code>
 relative to the directory from which undelete was invoked (i.e. as a 
file in the real filesystem and not the one you're processing).
</li><li>Name each file <code>file-nnnnn</code>, where <code>nnnnn</code> is the inode number of the deleted file.
</li><li>Restore each file's access time, modified time, and contents. For example, suppose the file <code>sample.txt</code> has inode number 12 and has been deleted from <code>sample-filesystem</code>. Running the <code>undelete</code> program on <code>sample-filesystem</code> should create a file <code>recovered_files/sample-filesystem/file-00012</code> with the access and modification timestamps of <code>sample.txt</code> and the same contents. See <code>man 3 futimes</code> for help with changing access and modification times.
</li><li>For deleted inodes that do not correspond to files, take no action.
</li><li>Restore only files that have been deleted. You <em>will</em> need to make use of the inode bitmap for this.
</li><li>There is a possibility that part of a deleted file has been 
reclaimed for use by something else. The goal of this project is not to 
build an extremely robust file recovery solution, so you don't need to 
worry about handling this gracefully.
</li><li>You will need to handle multiple level of data block 
indirection as well as multiple block groups. The provided filesystems 
do not exercise these features of <code>ext2</code> at all, so it is up to you to create sample filesystems that do.
</li><li>Do not seek unnecessarily through the filesystem file. In 
particular, you should not need to visit every single inode if there are
 many non-deleted files and only one deleted file.
</li><li>You may not keep an unbounded number of inodes and data blocks 
in memory at once (or any structure for that matter). In particular, you
 should be able to restore a 2 GiB filesystem with about 2 GiB worth of 
deleted files while using the same (small) amount of memory as if you 
were restoring a 10 MiB filesystem. You have some flexibility here; just
 make sure that the number of inodes and data blocks kept in memory is 
small relative to the size of the filesystems.
</li><li>You may not steal code from existing file recovery tools. Most 
build on existing frameworks, which isn't going to help you anyway, so 
just don't do it.
</li></ul>

<h3>Using the filesystem creation tool</h3>

<p>The filesystem creation tool provided with the starter code above is 
fairly simply, and you are free to customize it as you like. Here is 
what it contains:

<code>
</code></p><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 [filename] [size-in-1kB-blocks]"
    exit 1
fi

dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=$2 of=$1 &amp;&amp; mkfs.ext2 -F -b 1024 -c $1 &amp;&amp; \
  tune2fs -c0 -i0 $1 &amp;&amp; mkdir -p mnt &amp;&amp; sudo mount -o loop $1 mnt

echo

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Mount completed successfully! Use 'sudo umount mnt' to unmount"
else
    echo "Mount failed...please try again."
fi
</code></pre><code>
</code>

<ul>
<li>The <code>dd</code> command copies data from a device (in this case <code>/dev/zero</code>, which outputs 0s) to an output file using a given number of blocks of a certain size.
</li><li>The <code>mkfs.ext2</code> command creates an <code>ext2</code> filesystem in the given file with blocks of the given size (1024 bytes).
</li><li>The <code>tune2fs</code> command prevents the OS from running <code>fsck</code> on the filesystem automatically, since that could modify the filesystem in ways you don't expect.
</li><li>The <code>mkdir</code> command creates a mount point for the filesystem.
</li><li>The <code>mount</code> command mounts the filesystem using <code>mnt</code> as a mount point. Use this command by itself to mount an already-created filesystem.
</li></ul>

<p><code>mount</code> requires root privilege, so you will only be able to run this on your own machine or on a VM image.

</p><p>When you create a filesystem and mount it, you will not 
necessarily see the changes to the filesystem file until you unmount the
 filesystem. For example, let's say that you create and mount a 
filesystem file named <code>test</code>. You then create a file on it through <code>echo "Some file contents" &gt; mnt/sample.txt</code> and delete the file with <code>rm mnt/sample.txt</code>. Before you run your undelete tool to try to recover the file, first run <code>sudo umount mnt</code> to flush the changes to disk. To mount the filesystem again, use <code>sudo mount -o loop test mnt</code>. If you don't unmount the filesystem, you won't necessarily see the changes reflected in it.

</p><h4>Debugging</h4>

<p>An important part of this project is debugging. You're going to run 
into off-by-one errors - it's pretty much guaranteed, given that block 
and inode numbering is kind of funny. If it doesn't seem like you're 
reading the right data from the filesystem file for the block or inode 
number you are using, there are a couple different tools to help you. 
First of all, make liberal use of debug printing. To make a switch for 
enabling or disabling printing of debug statements, add some code like 
this near the top of your source file:

<code>
</code></p><pre><code>#define COMP3430_DEBUG 
#ifdef  COMP3430_DEBUG
#define LOG_PRINTF(...) printf(__VA_ARGS__)
#else
#define LOG_PRINTF(...)
#endif
</code></pre><code>
</code>

<p>Any macro name is fine, really, as long as you don't override any existing or commonly-used macros. Use <code>LOG_PRINTF</code> just as you would <code>printf</code>. To disable debug output, simply remove the <code>#define COMP3430_DEBUG</code> line.

</p><p>After setting up debug printing through something like the above,
 when you go to read something from disk, print out its absolute offset 
within the file as a hexadecimal value (e.g. 0x4000). If what you read 
at that point doesn't match your expectations, open the filesystem file 
using a hexeditor such as <code>hexedit</code>. Look at the data around 
that location. Was the data close by? Try to identify whether you were 
off by one index or whether you were looking in the wrong place 
entirely.

</p><p>There is a tool called <code>dumpe2fs</code> that will be very useful to you as well (see <code>man dumpe2fs</code>).
 It prints a variety of information about offsets, which inodes are 
free, etc. and you can (and should) use this for figuring out what the 
expected values at various points in your undelete utility are.

</p><p>When you want to test recovery of large files, try using image 
files. If you are able to recover a deleted image file, it should appear
 as before, and you should quickly be able to tell whether any of the 
data was corrupted.

</p><p><strong>Hints</strong>: Removing files in the kernel is a system call labeled as an '<code>unlink</code>.' The code that zeros out inodes is handled through code for the <code>ext2</code> file system specifically, <code>fs/ext2a</code>/.
 It will be close to impossible to get the extra credit working without a
 working version of undelete to test against, develop a working version 
of undelete with the older linux kernel prior to attempting the extra 
credit.

</p><h4><code>ext2</code> references</h4>

<p>There is a wealth of information about the layout of <code>ext2</code> filesystems online. In order of helpfulness, I would recommend reading the following pages:

</p><ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html">http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html</a>: If you were going to use only one reference for this project, it would be this one. It covers all attributes of <code>ext2</code> that you need to know.
</li><li><a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/tlk/fs/filesystem.html">http://www.tldp.org/LDP/tlk/fs/filesystem.html</a>: A description of <code>ext2</code> from a book about the Linux kernel from quite some time ago.
</li><li><a href="http://homepage.smc.edu/morgan_david/cs40/analyze-ext2.htm">http://homepage.smc.edu/morgan_david/cs40/analyze-ext2.htm</a>: Somewhat less technical than the above two sources, but walks through some helpful examples.
</li></ul>
